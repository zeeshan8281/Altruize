/* 
The payment-button and nft-purchase-button elements are assumed to be present in the HTML page, and event listeners are added to handle payment and NFT purchase actions.
When the payment button is clicked, the pay() function is called on the contract with the payment amount and sender's account address. Once the transaction is confirmed, the user is notified that the payment was successful.
When the NFT purchase button is clicked, the purchaseNFT() function is called on the contract with the sender's account address. Once the transaction is confirmed, the user is notified that the NFT was purchased and transferred to their wallet
